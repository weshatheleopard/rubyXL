This gem supports operating on +xlsx+ files (Open XML format). While it is capable
of properly parsing the entire OOXML structure, its current main emphasis is on
reading files produced by MS Excel, making minor modifications to them and saving
them to be opened again, while preserving as much of the structure as possible.

Please note that proprietary binary +xls+ format is *not* supported by this gem. If you need to parse those files, try {spreadsheet}[https://github.com/zdavatz/spreadsheet] gem.

== To Install:
  gem install rubyXL

== To Use:
  require 'rubyXL' # Assuming rubygems is already required

=== Convenience methods

Starting with version 3.4.0, the main data structure has been separated from the convenience methods that provide access to individual features of the +xlsx+ format, in order to decrease the memory footprint. If you intend to use these features, you will need to additionally include the respective files:
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods/cell'
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods/color'
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods/font'
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods/workbook'
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods/worksheet'

If you do not care about your RAM usage, just include them all at once by adding the following line to your code so it can continue operating just as before:
  require 'rubyXL/convenience_methods'

=== Parsing an existing workbook
  workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse("path/to/Excel/file.xlsx")

=== Creating a new Workbook
  workbook = RubyXL::Workbook.new

=== Accessing

==== Accessing a Worksheet
  workbook.worksheets[0] # Returns first worksheet
  workbook[0]            # Returns first worksheet
  workbook['Sheet1']     # Finds and returns worksheet titled "Sheet1"

==== Accessing a Row (Array of Cells)
Please note that worksheet is a _sparse_ array of rows. Your code *must* expect that any row it plucks from the array may be <tt>nil</tt>.

  worksheet = workbook[0]
  worksheet.sheet_data[0] # Returns first row of the worksheet
  worksheet[0]            # Returns first row of the worksheet

==== Accessing a Cell object
Please note that row is a _sparse_ array of cells. Your code *must* expect that any cell it plucks from the array may be <tt>nil</tt>.

  worksheet = workbook[0]
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0] # Returns cell A1 in the worksheet
  worksheet[0][0]            # Returns cell A1 in the worksheet

==== Wrappers for accessing Cell properties
  cell = workbook[0][0][0]
  cell.is_struckthrough  # Returns +true+ if the cell is struckthrough, other boolean properties have same syntax
  cell.font_name
  cell.font_size
  cell.font_color
  cell.fill_color
  cell.horizontal_alignment
  cell.vertical_alignment
  cell.get_border(:top)
  cell.get_border_color(:top)
  cell.text_rotation

==== Renaming Worksheets
  worksheet.sheet_name = 'Cool New Name' # Note that sheet name is limited to 31 characters by Excel.

==== Adding Cells
  worksheet.add_cell(0, 0, 'A1')      # Sets cell A1 to string "A1"
  worksheet.add_cell(0, 1, '', 'A1')  # Sets formula in the cell B1 to '=A1'
 
==== Changing Cells
  worksheet[0][0].change_contents("", worksheet[0][0].formula) # Sets value of cell A1 to empty string, preserves formula

==== Changing Fonts
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_font_bold(true) # Makes A1 bold
  worksheet.change_row_italics(0,true)              # Makes first row italicized
  worksheet.change_column_font_name(0, 'Courier')   # Makes first column have font Courier

==== Changing Fills	
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_fill('0ba53d')  # Sets A1 to have fill #0ba53d
  worksheet.change_row_fill(0, '0ba53d')            # Sets first row to have fill #0ba53d
  worksheet.change_column_fill(0, '0ba53d')         # Sets first column to have fill #0ba53d

==== Changing Borders
  # Possible weights: hairline, thin, medium, thick
  # Possible "directions": top, bottom, left, right, diagonal
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_border(:top, 'thin')  # Sets A1 to have a top, thin border
  worksheet.change_row_border(0, :left, 'hairline')       # Sets first row to have a left, hairline border
  worksheet.change_column_border(0, :diagonal, 'medium')  # Sets first column to have diagonal, medium border

  # Set the border style first so there's something to color.
  worksheet.change_row_border_color(0, :top, '0ba53d')    # Sets first row to have a green top border
  worksheet.change_column_border_color(0, :top, '0ba53d') # Sets first column to have a green top border

==== Changing Alignment
===== Horizontal
center, distributed, justify, left, right
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_horizontal_alignment('center') # Sets A1 to be centered
  worksheet.change_row_horizontal_alignment(0, 'justify')          # Sets first row to be justified
  worksheet.change_column_horizontal_alignment(0, 'right')         # Sets first column to be right-aligned

===== Vertical
bottom, center, distributed, top
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_vertical_alignment('bottom')  # Sets A1 to be bottom aligned
  worksheet.change_row_vertical_alignment(0, 'distributed')       # Sets first row to be distributed vertically
  worksheet.change_column_vertical_alignment(0, 'top')            # Sets first column to be top aligned
  
===== Rotation
  worksheet.sheet_data[0][0].change_text_rotation(90)  # Sets A1 to be rotated by 90 degrees

Values:
* 0-90 - degrees counterclockwise, around the bottom LEFT corner of the cell;
* 91-179 - degrees clockwise, around the bottom RIGHT corner of the cell;
* 180-254 - degrees clockwise, around the bottom LEFT corner of the cell, text becomes progressively invisible
* 255 - text is in normal rotation but displayed vertically (one letter under another), line feed starts new line to the right of the previous.

==== Changing Row Height
  worksheet.change_row_height(0, 30)  # Sets first row height to 30

==== Changing Column Width
  worksheet.change_column_width(0, 30)  # Sets first column width to 30

==== Merging Cells
  worksheet.merge_cells(0, 0, 1, 1)  # Merges A1:B2

==== Insert Row
This method will insert a row at specified index, pushing all rows below it down. It also copies styles from row above.

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted rows
  worksheet.insert_row(1)

==== Insert Column
This method will insert a column at specified index, pushing all columns to the right of it one to the right. It also copies styles from column to the left

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted columns
  worksheet.insert_column(1)

==== Delete Row
This method will delete a row at specified index, pushing all rows below it up.

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted rows
  worksheet.delete_row(1)

==== Delete Column
This method will delete a column at specified index, pushing all columns to the right of it left.

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted columns
  worksheet.delete_column(1)

==== Insert Cell
This method will insert a cell at specified position. It takes a :right or :down option, to shift cells either left or down upon inserting (nil means replacing the cell)

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted cells
  worksheet.insert_cell(0, 0, "blah", formula = nil, :right)  # Inserts cell at A1, shifts cells in first row right
  worksheet.insert_cell(0, 0, "blah", formula = nil, :down)   # Inserts cell at A1, shifts cells in first column down
  worksheet.insert_cell(0, 0, "blah")                         # Inserts cell at A1, shifts nothing

==== Delete Cell
This method will delete a cell at specified position. It takes a :left or :up option, to shift cells either up or left upon deletion (nil means simply deleting the cell contents)

WARNING: Use of this method WILL break formulas referencing cells which have been moved, as the formulas do not adapt to the shifted cells
  worksheet.delete_cell(0, 0, :left)  # Deletes A1, shifts contents of first row left
  worksheet.delete_cell(0, 0, :up)    # Deletes A1, shifts contents of first column up
  worksheet.delete_cell(0, 0)         # Deletes A1, does not shift cells

==== Modifying Cell Format
  cell = worksheet[0][0]
  cell.set_number_format '0.0000%'    # For formats, see https://support.office.com/en-us/article/5026bbd6-04bc-48cd-bf33-80f18b4eae68
  cell.change_text_wrap(true)         # Makes the text in the cell to wrap.
  cell.change_text_indent(1)          # Indents the text in the cell by 1 level

== I/O

By default, the gem operates with files on the local filesystem:

  workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse("path/to/Excel/file.xlsx")
  workbook.write("path/to/desired/Excel/file.xlsx")

It can also operate on +StringIO+ objects, thus eliminating the need to save the +xlsx+ file to disk. This capability comes in handy for web servers.

  workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse_buffer(buffer)
  workbook.stream

== Miscellaneous
  RubyXL::Reference.ind2ref(0,0) == 'A1'    # Converts row and column index to Excel-style cell reference
  RubyXL::Reference.ref2ind('A1') == [0, 0] # Converts Excel-style cell reference to row and column index

=== Suppress warnings about malformed input files

  RubyXL.class_variable_set(:@@suppress_warnings, true)

== For more information
Take a look at the files in spec/lib/ for rspecs on most methods

== Contributing to rubyXL
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
